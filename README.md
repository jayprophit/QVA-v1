### **Quantum Nexus Enhancements: Future Vision**

The QVA system is evolving with a new generation of features inspired by the Quantum Nexus vision:
- Streamlined, modular, and energy-efficient architecture
- Advanced self-awareness, self-improvement, and self-healing
- Self-replication and distributed scalability
- Integration of quantum, biological, and cosmological principles

See [System Enhancement Strategies](docs/implementation/system_enhancement_strategies.md#quantum-nexus-streamlined-self-improving-and-self-healing-enhancements) for a full modular breakdown and code examples.
