## 1. Voice, Speech, and Audio Recognition

### Task Overview:

* **Voice Recognition**: Identifying the identity of the speaker.
* **Speech Recognition**: Converting spoken words into text.
* **Audio/Sound Recognition**: Recognizing specific audio patterns (e.g., distinguishing between music, noise, and speech).

For these tasks, we will use **DeepSpeech** for ASR, **Librosa** for audio feature extraction, and **SpeechRecognition** to capture voice input.

### 1.1 Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) with DeepSpeech

```python
import deepspeech
import numpy as np
import wave
import speech_recognition as sr

# Load DeepSpeech pre-trained model
model_file_path = 'deepspeech-0.9.3-models.pbmm'  # Path to the model
scorer_file_path = 'deepspeech-0.9.3-models.scorer'  # Path to the scorer

model = deepspeech.Model(model_file_path)
model.enableExternalScorer(scorer_file_path)

# Function to recognize speech from an audio file
def speech_to_text(audio_file):
    with wave.open(audio_file, 'rb') as wf:
        frames = wf.getnframes()
        buffer = wf.readframes(frames)
        audio = np.frombuffer(buffer, dtype=np.int16)
        
        # Perform speech recognition using DeepSpeech
        text = model.stt(audio)
        return text

# Test the function with a sample WAV file
text_output = speech_to_text('test_audio.wav')
print(f"Recognized Speech: {text_output}")
```

### Explanation:

* **DeepSpeech**: This is an open-source ASR model based on deep learning. It converts spoken audio into text.
* **Wave Module**: Reads audio files in `.wav` format, which is commonly used for speech recognition tasks.
* The model processes the audio buffer to produce the recognized text.

### 1.2 Voice Recognition with SpeechRecognition Library

For voice identification and basic speech recognition, we can use the `speech_recognition` library.

```python
import speech_recognition as sr

# Initialize recognizer
recognizer = sr.Recognizer()

def recognize_voice():
    # Use the microphone to capture the audio input
    with sr.Microphone() as source:
        print("Listening...")
        audio = recognizer.listen(source)
    
    try:
        # Recognize speech using Google's speech recognition engine
        text = recognizer.recognize_google(audio)
        print(f"Recognized Text: {text}")
    except sr.UnknownValueError:
        print("Could not understand audio")
    except sr.RequestError as e:
        print(f"Recognition error: {e}")

# Call the voice recognition function
recognize_voice()
```

### Explanation:

* **SpeechRecognition Library**: Allows us to capture and process speech input using popular engines like Google Speech Recognition.
* This code captures audio from the microphone and recognizes the spoken language, converting it to text.

### 1.3 Audio Classification with Librosa

We can classify different types of sounds (e.g., music, noise, speech) using **audio feature extraction** and a neural network.

```python
import librosa
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model

# Load a pre-trained sound classification model
model = load_model('sound_classification_model.h5')

# Function to extract features from audio file
def extract_audio_features(audio_file):
    y, sr = librosa.load(audio_file, duration=5.0)  # Load audio file, limit to 5 seconds
    mfcc = librosa.feature.mfcc(y=y, sr=sr, n_mfcc=40)
    mfcc_scaled = np.mean(mfcc.T, axis=0)
    return mfcc_scaled

# Function to classify audio type
def classify_audio(audio_file):
    features = extract_audio_features(audio_file)
    features = np.expand_dims(features, axis=0)
    prediction = model.predict(features)
    class_label = np.argmax(prediction, axis=1)[0]
    
    if class_label == 0:
        return "Music"
    elif class_label == 1:
        return "Speech"
    elif class_label == 2:
        return "Noise"
    else:
        return "Unknown Sound"

# Test with an audio file
audio_class = classify_audio('audio_test.wav')
print(f"Detected Audio Class: {audio_class}")
```

### Explanation:

* **Librosa**: Extracts Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) from the audio file, which are then used as input features to a neural network model.
* **Audio Classification Model**: This pre-trained model can classify between different audio types (music, speech, noise).

---

## 2. Music Recognition and Genre Classification

### Task Overview:

* **Music Recognition**: Identify or classify music genres (e.g., rock, jazz, classical).

For this, we can also use **Librosa** for audio feature extraction and train a model for genre classification.

```python
import librosa
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Dropout, LSTM

# Load a music audio file and extract features
def extract_music_features(audio_file):
    y, sr = librosa.load(audio_file, duration=30)
    mfcc = librosa.feature.mfcc(y=y, sr=sr, n_mfcc=40)
    mfcc_scaled = np.mean(mfcc.T, axis=0)
    return mfcc_scaled

# Create a simple neural network model for genre classification
def create_music_model():
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(Dense(256, input_shape=(40,), activation='relu'))
    model.add(Dropout(0.3))
    model.add(Dense(128, activation='relu'))
    model.add(Dropout(0.3))
    model.add(Dense(10, activation='softmax'))  # Assuming 10 music genres
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model

# Load pre-trained model (assumed to be already trained)
music_model = create_music_model()
music_model.load_weights('music_genre_model.h5')

# Classify music genre
def classify_music_genre(audio_file):
    features = extract_music_features(audio_file)
    features = np.expand_dims(features, axis=0)
    prediction = music_model.predict(features)
    genre_label = np.argmax(prediction, axis=1)[0]
    
    genre_dict = {0: "Rock", 1: "Jazz", 2: "Classical", 3: "Pop", 4: "Hip-Hop"}
    return genre_dict.get(genre_label, "Unknown Genre")

# Test the music classification
genre = classify_music_genre('song_sample.wav')
print(f"Detected Music Genre: {genre}")
```

### Explanation:

* **Librosa**: Extracts the MFCC features from the music file, which is common for genre classification tasks.
* **Music Model**: The neural network model is designed to classify music into different genres. You can train it on a dataset like **GTZAN**.

## 3. Language Recognition (NLP)

To recognize and classify the language spoken in an audio file, we can use pre-trained models from **Transformers** for text-based language detection after converting speech to text.

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Initialize a language identification pipeline
language_identifier = pipeline("translation", model="Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-multi")

# Function to detect language
def detect_language(text):
    return language_identifier(text)[0]['translation_text']

# Example text input for language recognition
text_input = "Bonjour, comment ça va?"
detected_language = detect_language(text_input)
print(f"Detected Language: {detected_language}")
```

### Explanation:

* **Transformers**: This powerful library from Hugging Face allows us to perform various NLP tasks, including translation and language detection.
* **Language Recognition**: This system detects the language of the given text by using translation models trained on multilingual datasets.

---

## 4. Image Recognition and Classification

For image recognition, we can use **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, such as **ResNet**, **VGG16**, or **MobileNetV2**. These models can classify images into categories or identify objects within images.

```python
import cv2
from tensorflow.keras.applications import MobileNetV2
from tensorflow.keras.applications.mobilenet_v2 import preprocess_input
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import image
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Load pre-trained MobileNetV2 model
image_model = MobileNetV2(weights='imagenet')

# Function to recognize objects in an image
def recognize_image(image_path):
    img = image.load_img(image_path, target_size=(224, 224))
    img_array = image.img_to_array(img)
    img_array = np.expand_dims(img_array, axis=0)  # Add a batch dimension
    img_array = preprocess_input(img_array)  # Preprocess the image as per MobileNetV2 requirements

    # Make predictions
    predictions = image_model.predict(img_array)

    # Decode the predictions into readable labels
    decoded_predictions = tf.keras.applications.mobilenet_v2.decode_predictions(predictions, top=3)[0]
    
    # Print the top 3 predictions
    for i, (imagenet_id, label, score) in enumerate(decoded_predictions):
        print(f"Prediction {i+1}: {label} - {score*100:.2f}%")

# Test the image recognition function
image_path = 'test_image.jpg'
recognize_image(image_path)
```

### Explanation:

* **MobileNetV2**: A lightweight CNN model designed for efficient image recognition tasks, pre-trained on the **ImageNet** dataset with over 1000 object categories.
* **Image Preprocessing**: The image is resized to 224x224, converted into a numpy array, and preprocessed using MobileNet's internal normalization function.
* **Prediction and Decoding**: The model's predictions are decoded using `decode_predictions` to return human-readable labels and their corresponding confidence scores.

## 5. Noise and Environmental Sound Recognition

To classify environmental sounds, such as distinguishing between different types of noise (e.g., traffic, wind, rain), we can use a sound classification model trained on the **UrbanSound8K** dataset or similar.

```python
import librosa
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model

# Load pre-trained environmental sound classification model
sound_model = load_model('environmental_sound_classification_model.h5')

# Function to extract features from sound
def extract_sound_features(audio_file):
    y, sr = librosa.load(audio_file, duration=5)
    mfcc = librosa.feature.mfcc(y=y, sr=sr, n_mfcc=40)
    return np.mean(mfcc.T, axis=0)

# Function to classify environmental sounds
def classify_sound(audio_file):
    features = extract_sound_features(audio_file)
    features = np.expand_dims(features, axis=0)
    
    # Predict using the sound classification model
    prediction = sound_model.predict(features)
    class_label = np.argmax(prediction, axis=1)[0]
    
    # Mapping of sound classes (assuming you have 10 environmental sound classes)
    sound_classes = {
        0: 'Car Horn',
        1: 'Dog Barking',
        2: 'Drilling',
        3: 'Engine Idling',
        4: 'Gun Shot',
        5: 'Jackhammer',
        6: 'Siren',
        7: 'Street Music',
        8: 'Air Conditioner',
        9: 'Children Playing'
    }
    
    return sound_classes.get(class_label, 'Unknown Sound')

# Test the sound recognition function
sound_class = classify_sound('test_environmental_sound.wav')
print(f"Detected Sound Class: {sound_class}")
```

### Explanation:

* **Librosa**: Used to extract MFCC features from the sound file, which are then passed to a pre-trained model for sound classification.
* **Sound Classes**: A mapping of environmental sound classes such as sirens, car horns, and barking dogs, typically used in urban sound classification models.
