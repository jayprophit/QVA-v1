# Bee Communication Module

This submodule details QVAâ€™s approach to decoding, simulating, and integrating bee communication for pollination optimization and environmental monitoring.

## Features
- **Bioacoustics**: Decode bee wing vibrations and hive sounds.
- **Visual Signals**: Analyze waggle dance patterns for resource mapping.
- **Integration**: Connect with agriculture and ecosystem modules for pollination and crop yield.

### Example Code
```python
class BeeDanceInterpreter:
    def interpret_dance(self, video_input):
        # Analyze bee waggle dance for direction and distance
        pass
```
