## 2. Data Access and Integration

### Data Sources

The QVA accesses engineering knowledge from multiple sources:

* **Historical Engineering Database**: Contains engineering principles and designs from ancient civilizations to modern times
* **Patent and Innovation Repository**: Comprehensive collection of patents, innovations, and engineering breakthroughs
* **Scientific Literature Database**: Access to research papers across engineering disciplines
* **Engineering Standards Database**: Industry standards, specifications, and best practices
* **Real-Time Data Sources**: Current engineering trends and emerging technologies

```python
class EngineeringDataAccess:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data_sources = {
            'historical': HistoricalEngineeringDB(),
            'patents': PatentRepository(),
            'literature': ScientificLiteratureDB(),
            'standards': EngineeringStandardsDB(),
            'realtime': RealTimeDataSource()
        }
    
    def fetch_engineering_data(self, query, sources=None):
        """Retrieve engineering data based on query from specified sources"""
        if sources is None:
            sources = self.data_sources.keys()
            
        results = {}
        for source in sources:
            if source in self.data_sources:
                results[source] = self.data_sources[source].query(query)
                
        return results
```

### API Integration

The system interfaces with external engineering resources through standardized APIs:

```python
class EngineeringAPIManager:
    def __init__(self, api_keys=None):
        self.api_keys = api_keys or {}
        self.api_clients = {
            'materials_science': MaterialsAPI(self.api_keys.get('materials', None)),
            'cad_systems': CADSystemAPI(self.api_keys.get('cad', None)),
            'simulation': SimulationAPI(self.api_keys.get('simulation', None)),
            'patents': PatentSearchAPI(self.api_keys.get('patents', None))
        }
    
    def query_api(self, api_name, parameters):
        """Query a specific engineering API with parameters"""
        if api_name in self.api_clients:
            return self.api_clients[api_name].execute_query(parameters)
        return None
```

## 3. Knowledge Representation

### Engineering Knowledge Graph

The system organizes engineering knowledge in a comprehensive graph structure that represents relationships between:

* Engineering principles
* Materials and their properties
* Design patterns and methodologies
* Historical innovations and their evolution

```python
import networkx as nx

class EngineeringKnowledgeGraph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.graph = nx.MultiDiGraph()
        
    def add_engineering_concept(self, concept, properties=None):
        """Add an engineering concept to the knowledge graph"""
        self.graph.add_node(concept, **properties or {})
        
    def add_relationship(self, concept1, concept2, relationship_type, properties=None):
        """Add a relationship between engineering concepts"""
        self.graph.add_edge(concept1, concept2, 
                           relationship_type=relationship_type, 
                           **properties or {})
        
    def query_related_concepts(self, concept, relationship_type=None, max_depth=2):
        """Find related engineering concepts"""
        if concept not in self.graph:
            return []
            
        if relationship_type:
            edges = [(u, v) for u, v, e in self.graph.edges(concept, data=True) 
                    if e.get('relationship_type') == relationship_type]
        else:
            edges = self.graph.edges(concept)
            
        related = [v for _, v in edges]
        
        # For deeper relationships
        if max_depth > 1:
            for related_concept in related:
                related.extend(self.query_related_concepts(
                    related_concept, relationship_type, max_depth-1))
                
        return list(set(related))
```

### Temporal Knowledge Management

The system maintains engineering knowledge across different time periods, from ancient techniques to future concepts:

```python
class TemporalEngineeringKnowledge:
    def __init__(self):
        # Time periods from ancient to future
        self.time_periods = [
            "ancient", "medieval", "renaissance", "industrial_revolution",
            "modern", "contemporary", "emerging", "future_concepts"
        ]
        self.period_knowledge = {period: {} for period in self.time_periods}
        
    def add_temporal_knowledge(self, concept, time_period, details):
        """Add engineering knowledge for a specific time period"""
        if time_period in self.period_knowledge:
            if concept not in self.period_knowledge[time_period]:
                self.period_knowledge[time_period][concept] = []
            self.period_knowledge[time_period][concept].append(details)
            
    def query_concept_evolution(self, concept):
        """Trace the evolution of an engineering concept through time"""
        evolution = []
        for period in self.time_periods:
            if concept in self.period_knowledge[period]:
                evolution.append({
                    'period': period,
                    'knowledge': self.period_knowledge[period][concept]
                })
        return evolution
```

## 4. Cross-Disciplinary Engineering Integration

```python
class EngineeringReasoningEngine:
    def __init__(self, knowledge_graph, temporal_knowledge):
        self.knowledge_graph = knowledge_graph
        self.temporal_knowledge = temporal_knowledge

        # Gather relevant knowledge across disciplines
        cross_disciplinary_knowledge = {}
        for discipline in disciplines:
            cross_disciplinary_knowledge[discipline] = self._retrieve_discipline_knowledge(
                concepts, discipline)
            
        # Apply engineering principles to solve problem
        solution = self._apply_principles(problem_statement, 
                                         cross_disciplinary_knowledge)

    def _retrieve_discipline_knowledge(self, concepts, discipline):
        """Retrieve knowledge for concepts in a specific discipline"""
        discipline_knowledge = {}
        for concept in concepts:
            # Query both current and historical knowledge
            discipline_knowledge[concept] = {
                'current': self.knowledge_graph.query_related_concepts(
                    f"{discipline}_{concept}"),
                'evolution': self.temporal_knowledge.query_concept_evolution(
                    f"{discipline}_{concept}")
            }
        return discipline_knowledge
        
    def _apply_principles(self, problem, knowledge):
        """Apply engineering principles to solve the problem"""
        # This would involve complex reasoning in a real implementation
