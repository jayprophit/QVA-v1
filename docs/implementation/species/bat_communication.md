# Bat Communication Module

This module details QVAâ€™s approach to decoding, simulating, and integrating bat echolocation and social calls for nocturnal ecosystem monitoring and species conservation.

## Features
- **Echolocation Analysis**: Decode ultrasonic pulses for navigation, prey detection, and obstacle avoidance.
- **Social Calls**: Analyze frequency-modulated calls for colony coordination and mating.
- **Integration**: Connect with acoustic sensor networks, drone-based monitoring, and cave ecosystem modules.

### Example Code
```python
class BatEcholocationAnalyzer:
    def analyze_echolocation(self, audio_input):
        # Analyze bat ultrasonic pulses for navigation and prey detection
        pass
```
