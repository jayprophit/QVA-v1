# Intelligent Plant & Animal Communication in Agriculture

This module details QVA's capabilities for decoding and translating plant and animal signals to optimize agricultural productivity and sustainability.

## Core Features
- **Plant Communication**: Detect electrochemical signals for water, nutrient, or pest stress; leverage fungal networks for coordination.
- **Animal Communication**: Analyze vocalizations, body language, and behaviors for health, distress, or hunger.

### Example Code
```python
class PlantStressDetector:
    def detect_stress(self, plant_bioelectric_signal):
        if plant_bioelectric_signal == "water_stress":
            return self.water_management_protocol()
        elif plant_bioelectric_signal == "pest_attack":
            return self.pest_control_protocol()
        return "Unknown stress signal"
```

## Integration with QVA Modules
- **Robotics**: Connect to farm robots and drones for automated monitoring and intervention.
- **IoT & Sensors**: Use real-time data from soil, weather, and livestock sensors.
- **System Enhancement**: Integrate with resource management and environmental protection modules.

## Integration with External Systems
- **Agricultural APIs**: Sync with weather, crop, and pest databases.
- **Drone Fleets**: Automate crop monitoring and targeted interventions.
