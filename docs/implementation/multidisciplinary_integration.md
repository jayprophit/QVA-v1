* **Behavioral models**: Predicts and simulates how individuals or groups act in specific situations
* **Emotional models**: Understands psychological states (builds upon the emotional intelligence implementation)

### Cognitive Behavioral Implementation

```python
class CognitiveBehavioralModel:
    def __init__(self):
        self.negative_thoughts = ["I'm not good enough", "I can't do it"]
        self.positive_responses = ["You can succeed", "You have the skills"]

    def assess_situation(self, input_thought):
        if input_thought in self.negative_thoughts:
            response = self.positive_responses[self.negative_thoughts.index(input_thought)]
            return response
        else:
            return "Keep going!"
```
