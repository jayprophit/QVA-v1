## अध्याय १: परिचय (Overview) <a name="adhyaya-1"></a>

**Shloka:**
Multi-agent systems enable distributed intelligence and collaborative problem solving.

**Commentary:**
This section introduces the concept and significance of multi-agent systems in modern AI.

## Overview
The Multi-Agent AI System forms a distributed intelligence layer within the QVA platform, comprising specialized autonomous agents that collaborate to accomplish complex tasks. This architecture allows for parallelized processing, domain-specific expertise, and resilient system behavior through collective intelligence approaches.
