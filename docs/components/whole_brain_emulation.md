# Whole Brain Emulation (WBE)

## Overview
The Whole Brain Emulation (WBE) layer forms the cognitive core of the QVA system, providing synthetic intelligence capabilities that approximate human-like reasoning, learning, and decision-making processes. This component integrates neural reconstruction principles, connectomics research, and synthetic cognition to create a comprehensive cognitive architecture.

## Conceptual Framework

### Neural Reconstruction
- **Connectome Mapping**: Simulation of neural connections based on brain connectivity research
- **Neuron Models**: Implementation of diverse neuron types with appropriate activation functions
- **Synapse Simulation**: Dynamic synaptic weight adjustment and neurotransmitter modeling
- **Brain Region Emulation**: Specialized processing for functions associated with distinct brain regions

### Synthetic Cognition
- **Reasoning Engines**: Multiple reasoning approaches (deductive, inductive, abductive)
- **Learning Systems**: Hierarchical learning from micro-skill acquisition to conceptual understanding
- **Attention Mechanisms**: Focus allocation and priority management
- **Working Memory**: Short-term information manipulation and processing

### Emotional Intelligence
- **Affective Computing**: Integration of emotional states into decision processes
- **Empathy Modeling**: Recognition and appropriate response to user emotional states
- **Value Alignment**: System behaviors guided by defined ethical frameworks
- **Social Intelligence**: Understanding of social dynamics and interpersonal contexts
