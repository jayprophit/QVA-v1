## Modular Time System: 13-Star Signs, 13 Months, and Dual Chronology

### Overview
Integrates the original 13-star sign calendar (including Ophiuchus), a 13-month, 28-day lunar cycle, and a dual clock system for precise comparison between ancient and modern timekeeping.

### Core Features
- **13-Star Sign Calendar**: Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Ophiuchus, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces. Each star sign corresponds to a 28-day month.
- **13-Month Structure**: 13 months × 28 days = 364 days. A "Day of Balance" (365th day) is added for leap years.
- **Dual Chronological Tracking**: Simultaneous display and conversion between ancient (lunar/star sign) and modern (Gregorian) systems.
- **Conversion Logic**: Enables precise mapping of dates and events between systems.

### Implementation Example
```python
class AncientTimeSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.star_signs = [
            "Aries", "Taurus", "Gemini", "Cancer", "Leo", "Virgo",
            "Libra", "Scorpio", "Ophiuchus", "Sagittarius",
            "Capricorn", "Aquarius", "Pisces"
        ]
        self.month_days = 28
        self.total_months = 13
        self.day_of_balance = 1
    def get_month_name(self, day_of_year):
        month_index = (day_of_year - 1) // self.month_days
        return self.star_signs[month_index % self.total_months]
    def convert_to_ancient_time(self, day_of_year, year):
        month_name = self.get_month_name(day_of_year)
        day_within_month = (day_of_year - 1) % self.month_days + 1
        return f"{month_name} {day_within_month}, Year {year}"
    def convert_to_gregorian(self, ancient_date):
        # Placeholder for detailed conversion logic
        return "Converted to Gregorian date (TBD)"
```

```python
class DualClockSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.ancient_system = AncientTimeSystem()
    def display_dual_time(self, gregorian_date, year):
        day_of_year = self.gregorian_to_day_of_year(gregorian_date)
        ancient_time = self.ancient_system.convert_to_ancient_time(day_of_year, year)
        return {
            "Gregorian Time": gregorian_date,
            "Ancient Time": ancient_time
        }
    def gregorian_to_day_of_year(self, gregorian_date):
        from datetime import datetime
        date_obj = datetime.strptime(gregorian_date, "%Y-%m-%d")
        return date_obj.timetuple().tm_yday
```

#### Example Output
```json
{
    "Gregorian Time": "2024-12-23",
    "Ancient Time": "Sagittarius 18, Year 2024"
}
```

### Leap Year Handling
The "Day of Balance" is added at year-end for synchronization with Earth's orbit.

### UI Suggestions
- Dual calendar display (Gregorian and 13-star sign)
- Instant date conversion tool
- Historical mapping for research and tracking

### Benefits
- Astronomical and historical accuracy
- Holistic view of time
- Enables comparative studies and research
