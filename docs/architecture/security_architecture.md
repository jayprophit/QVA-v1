# Security Architecture

## Overview
The QVA system implements a comprehensive, defense-in-depth security architecture designed to protect the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of the system across all access tiers. Security controls are integrated at every layer of the architecture, from the physical infrastructure to the application interface, ensuring robust protection while enabling the required functionality for each access level.

## Security Design Principles

### Zero Trust Architecture
- **Verify Explicitly**: Authentication and authorization for every access request
- **Least Privilege Access**: Minimal permissions needed for each operation
- **Assume Breach**: Design with the assumption that barriers will be compromised
- **Segmentation**: Isolation of components to contain potential breaches

### Defense in Depth
- **Multiple Security Layers**: Overlapping controls across system architecture
- **Diverse Control Types**: Different protection mechanisms at each layer
- **Resilient Design**: Continued protection despite partial component failure
- **Adaptive Defense**: Security posture changes based on threat intelligence

### Privacy by Design
- **Data Minimization**: Collection limited to necessary information
- **Purpose Limitation**: Clear boundaries on data usage
- **Storage Constraints**: Defined retention policies for all data types
- **User Control**: Granular management of personal information

## Access Control Framework

### Identity Management
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Combination of knowledge, possession, and inherence factors
- **Identity Federation**: Integration with enterprise identity providers
- **Privileged Access Management**: Enhanced controls for administrative accounts
- **Identity Lifecycle**: Comprehensive management from creation to retirement
