---

### **Mangala Shloka (Invocation)**

```text
Om! May the union of senses bring deeper understanding and harmony to all intelligence.
```

## **Shloka 13.1: Principle**
Combining text, image, audio, and sensor data for richer inference and more robust AI.

## **Shloka 13.2: Key Technologies**
- Custom pipelines (NLP + Vision + Audio)

## **Shloka 13.3: Example**
```python
# Example: NLP + Vision
text_result = nlp('Describe this image')
vision_result = model.detect_objects('image.jpg')
```

## **Shloka 13.4: Integration Commentary**
- Used for advanced analytics, context-aware assistants, and robotics.
- See [overview_and_innovations.md](../overview_and_innovations.md) for vision and use cases.
