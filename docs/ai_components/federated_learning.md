# Federated Learning

Federated learning enables decentralized model training without sharing raw data.

## Key Technologies
- Custom federated averaging

## Example (Pseudocode)
```python
weights = [model.get_weights() for model in models]
avg_weights = np.mean(weights, axis=0)
for model in models:
    model.set_weights(avg_weights)
```

## Integration Notes
- Used for privacy-preserving training across distributed devices.
