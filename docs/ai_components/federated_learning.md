## **Shloka 8.3: Example (Pseudocode)**
```python
weights = [model.get_weights() for model in models]
avg_weights = np.mean(weights, axis=0)
for model in models:
    model.set_weights(avg_weights)
```

## **Shloka 8.4: Integration Commentary**
- Used for privacy-preserving training across distributed devices.
