# Adhyaya 2: Computer Vision

---

### **Mangala Shloka (Invocation)**

```text
Om! May the vision of this module reveal the world in all its detail and guide intelligent perception.
```

## **Shloka 2.1: Principle**
Computer vision powers object detection, image analysis, and visual recognition in Quantum Nexus.

## **Shloka 2.2: Key Technologies**
- OpenCV
- Deep learning models (YOLO, CNNs)

## **Shloka 2.3: Example â€” Object Detection**
```python
import cv2
model = cv2.dnn.readNet('yolov3.weights', 'yolov3.cfg')
# See architecture doc for full pipeline
```

## **Shloka 2.4: Integration Commentary**
- Used in robotics, security, and UI enhancements.
- See [architecture/integrated_system_design.md](../architecture/integrated_system_design.md).
