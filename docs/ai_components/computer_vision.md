# Computer Vision

Computer vision powers object detection, image analysis, and visual recognition in Quantum Nexus.

## Key Technologies
- OpenCV
- Deep learning models (YOLO, CNNs)

## Example: Object Detection
```python
import cv2
model = cv2.dnn.readNet('yolov3.weights', 'yolov3.cfg')
# See architecture doc for full pipeline
```

## Integration Notes
- Used in robotics, security, and UI enhancements.
- See [architecture/integrated_system_design.md](../architecture/integrated_system_design.md).
