## **Shloka 3.1: Principle**
RL agents enable adaptive optimization and control in Quantum Nexus.

## **Shloka 3.2: Key Technologies**
- OpenAI Gym
- TensorFlow / PyTorch

## **Shloka 3.3: Example — Basic RL Loop**
```python
import gym
env = gym.make('CartPole-v1')
state = env.reset()
for _ in range(100):
    action = env.action_space.sample()
    state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
    if done: break
```

## **Shloka 3.4: Integration Commentary**
- Used for quantum circuit optimization, robotics, and dynamic resource management.

### **Phala Shruti (Result)**
- Enables continuous improvement and self-optimization in dynamic environments.
