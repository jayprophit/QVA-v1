# Reinforcement Learning (RL)

RL agents enable adaptive optimization and control in Quantum Nexus.

## Key Technologies
- OpenAI Gym
- TensorFlow / PyTorch

## Example: Basic RL Loop
```python
import gym
env = gym.make('CartPole-v1')
state = env.reset()
for _ in range(100):
    action = env.action_space.sample()
    state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
    if done: break
```

## Integration Notes
- Used for quantum circuit optimization, robotics, and dynamic resource management.
